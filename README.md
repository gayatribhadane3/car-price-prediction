# car-price-prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the selling price of cars using Machine Learning regression techniques. The model analyzes various car features to estimate an accurate market price, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Car prices depend on multiple factors such as manufacturing year, mileage, fuel type, and ownership history. Manually estimating prices can be inaccurate. This project builds a regression-based Machine Learning model to predict car prices based on historical data.

## 🔍 Approach
1. Data loading and understanding  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Feature encoding and transformation  
4. Train-test split  
5. Model training using Linear Regression  
6. Model evaluation using:
   - R² Score  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  

---

## ✅ Results
The Linear Regression model was able to predict car prices with reasonable accuracy. Performance was evaluated using R², MAE, and MSE to measure prediction effectiveness.
